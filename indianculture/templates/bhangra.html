            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
Bhangra, a traditional dance form, originated in the Sialkot District of Punjab and was founded by Punjabi Jatts. Traditionally performed during the harvest season between April and the first quarter of May, Bhangra has roots in the Punjabi dance 'Bagaa,' a martial dance of Punjab. The folk dance of Bhangra originated in the Sialkot district of Majha and is traditionally maintained in Gurdaspur district, India. It is performed in a circle with traditional steps and has expanded beyond the harvest season. Bhangra's origin in Sialkot has connections to Jammu, making it part of the heritage of the region, which shares linguistic influences with Punjab. Jammu falls within the Punjab region and has a historical affinity with Punjab.</p>

            <h2>Costume</h2>
            <p>Bhangra costumes play a significant role in the vibrant and energetic performances of this traditional dance form. Known as vardiyaan, these costumes enhance the aesthetic appeal of the dance while emphasizing the fluidity of movements. Men typically wear a kurta, vest, and a tied chadr, while women opt for a kurta, vest, and a draped salwar or chadr. The colorful attire, adorned with intricate designs, adds to the visual spectacle.</p>
            <p>In addition to the basic ensemble, dancers may wear accessories such as pagh (turban) for men and chunni (headscarf) for women, reflecting the Sikh influence in Punjab. Jewelry like necklaces and earrings, along with handkerchiefs (rumaalan) on wrists, serves as embellishments that highlight specific movements during the performance. Bhangra costumes are not just attire; they carry historical significance, cultural traditions, and symbolic elements, contributing to the richness of the dance experience.</p>

            <h2>Musical Instruments</h2>
            <p>
Bhangra, a lively traditional dance, is accompanied by a variety of distinctive instruments. The algozey, resembling two fused wooden flutes, creates rhythmic sounds. The chimta, a pair of metal tongs with bells, adds a chiming element to the music. The dhad, a small hourglass-shaped drum, produces a high-pitched sound, while the iconic dhol, a double-sided drum, plays a central role in shaping the rhythm of the performance. Bhangra dancers use the katos, shaped like a squirrel, strumming its strings in sync with the beat. The khunda, a decorated bamboo stick, accentuates the dancers' movements, while saaps (shikke) generate thunder-like claps. The tumbi, a small gourd-shaped stringed instrument, complements the dhol and boliyan, contributing to the vibrant musical ensemble behind the energetic Bhangra performers.

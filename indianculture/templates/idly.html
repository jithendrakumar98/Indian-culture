            <h2>History: </h2>
            <p>The history of Idli-Sambar dates back centuries and is deeply rooted in South Indian culinary traditions. Idli, the steamed rice cake, is believed to have originated in present-day Karnataka. It is mentioned in ancient Indian texts, indicating its long-standing presence in the region. Over time, the dish spread to other parts of South India, becoming an integral part of the breakfast culture.
Sambar, the lentil-based vegetable stew, also has ancient origins. It is associated with the Maratha ruler Shahuji, who is said to have introduced the dish to the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom in the 18th century. Since then, Sambar has become a ubiquitous accompaniment in South Indian cuisine.

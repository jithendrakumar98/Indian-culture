      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Kathakali is a traditional Indian dance-drama form that incorporates elements from ancient Sanskrit texts, including the Natya Shastra, attributed to the sage Bharata. The Natya Shastra is a comprehensive treatise on performing arts and is dated between 200 BC and 200 AD, though some estimates place it between 500 BC and 500 AD. The most studied version of the Natya Shastra consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters.</p>
       <p>The roots of Kathakali are a subject of debate, with varying opinions on its age. Some scholars, like Jones and Ryan, suggest it is more than 500 years old, while others, like Mahinder Singh, claim its roots are more ancient, dating back around 1500 years. Kathakali emerged as a distinct genre of performance art in the 16th and 17th centuries in Kerala, but its foundations are believed to have deeper historical connections. The dance form serves as a unique expression of spiritual ideas, virtues, and the essence of scriptures, as emphasized in the Natya Shastra.

 <h2>Costumes</h2>

<p>Kathakali, among classical Indian dances, stands out for its elaborate costuming, involving head dresses, face masks, and vividly painted faces. It takes several hours to prepare a Kathakali troupe for a performance, captivating both adults and children with its vibrant colors, makeup, lights, and sounds.

The makeup in Kathakali follows a code to help the audience identify characters easily. Seven basic makeup types are used, including Pachcha (green) for noble characters like Krishna, Pazhuppu (ripe) for various roles, Kathi for heroic characters, Kari (black) for forest dwellers, Thaadi (red) for characters with an evil streak, Minukku (yellow) for monks and women, and Teppu for special mythological characters.</p>
<p>The colors and styles convey the inner nature of characters; for example, green with coral red lips for noble figures, red for evil characters, black for forest dwellers, and yellow for virtuous feminine characters. White beard signifies a divine being, while special characters like Garuda and Hamsa have unique makeup. Face masks and headgear further accentuate character traits, and garment colors follow a silent communication code within the community.</p>

 <h2>Songs and musical instruments</h2>

<p>Kathakali performances are presented in verse form, featuring metered and lyrical lines sung by trained vocalists. These vocalists not only deliver lines but also set context and express characters' inner states through voice modulation. For instance, anger is conveyed with a sharp high voice, while pleading is expressed with a sad tone.

Music plays a central role, setting the mood and triggering emotions corresponding to the scene's nature. Different musical patterns accompany various moods and scenes, such as Chempada for battles, Chempa for tension, Panchari for preparatory moments, Triputa for thought-provoking scenes, Adantha for regal or divine moments, and Muri Adantha for light-hearted or fast-paced scenes.</p>
<p>A variety of musical instruments are employed in Kathakali, with major drums including the barrel-shaped Maddalam, cylindrical Chenda played with curved sticks, and the hourglass-shaped Idakka producing muted and melodious notes during performances involving female characters.</p>

 <h2>Styles: Sampradayam</h2>

<p>
Kathakali has distinctive schools of play interpretation and dance performance called Sampradayam. Two major surviving styles are the Kidangoor style, influenced by Kutiyattam and associated with Nalanunni, and the Kalluvazhi style, a synthesis of older performance arts attributed to Unniri Panikkar, which became dominant at Kerala Kalamandalam. These styles reflect the diversity and rich heritage of Kathakali, shaped through the gurukula system of transmission.
